# PROGRESS — Cockroach Chat build ledger

This is the **single source of truth for "what's done / what's next."** The Ralph loop
(and any agent) reads this file first, does the **next unchecked task**, then updates it.

- Do the **smallest next unchecked `[ ]` task**, not a whole milestone.
- When a task is genuinely done **and verified** (tests/build pass — paste the command you
  ran), check it `[x]` and add a one-line note under it.
- If blocked, mark the task `[!]`, write the blocker under **Blockers**, and move to the
  next independent task.
- Keep this file honest. A checked box means verified, not "written."

**Status:** M0 core is **complete and green** — `cargo test --workspace` passes (49 core unit
tests + golden vectors + 3 topology + 6 mesh scenarios), `clippy -D warnings` clean, and the
200-node broadcast sim delivers to 97.5% of nodes. Remaining M0 tail (SQLCipher, UniFFI, JVM
smoke) is toolchain-gated and deferred into M1 where it is actually testable — see notes.
**Current milestone:** M0 done except gated tail → next up is **M1 (Android BLE glue)**.

Verify everything: `cargo test --workspace && cargo run -p sim -- --nodes 200 --scenario broadcast`

## M0 — Rust core + simulator

### Scaffolding
- [x] `docs/protocol.md` v0.1 (wire format, message types, all tunable numbers).
- [x] `docs/decisions/ADR-0001-rust-core-uniffi.md`.
- [x] Cargo workspace: root `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `crates/{meshcore,sim}`. `cargo build --workspace` ok. *(meshcore-ffi crate deferred to M1 — see gated tail.)*
- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` rust job: fmt + clippy `-D warnings` + test + vectors + sim smoke.

### meshcore — protocol core (pure, sans-IO)
- [x] `wire`: Header/Packet/MsgType/Tlv codec; unknown version rejected, unknown type preserved+relayed. 10 unit tests incl. fuzz-style short-buffer/oversize/trailing.
- [x] Golden vectors: `testvectors/packets.json` generated (`REGEN_VECTORS=1`) and verified by `tests/vectors.rs`; CI diffs against fresh bytes.
- [x] `frag`: fragmenter/reassembler sized to 182 B; 128 slots / 30 s / 1 MiB caps; out-of-order + duplicate + timeout tests.
- [x] `identity`: Ed25519+X25519, deterministic-from-seed, rotating eph id, hashcash `pow::mint`/`verify`.
- [x] `clock` (injected) + `config` (`Tunables` holds every protocol number, incl. relay probabilities).
- [x] `relay`: SeenCache (dedup+hear count), RateLimiter (token bucket + greylist), RelayScheduler (jitter + suppression), density-adaptive probability. All unit-tested.
- [x] `store`: `Store` trait + `MemoryStore` (history caps, envelopes, panic_wipe). Stores original packet bytes so sync preserves digests.
- [x] `channels`: name normalization + `SyncFilter` set-reconciliation.
- [x] `transport`: `Transport` trait + `TransportEvent`.
- [x] `node`: `MeshNode` orchestrator — announce, channel send/receive, sync, relay, tick; emits `MeshEvent`; sans-IO.

### sim — deterministic simulator
- [x] `SimTransport` + `SimClock` + `World` radio model (per-edge latency/loss/mtu). **Determinism** secured by using `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet` in the core (HashMap iteration order was breaking reproducibility). Airtime-budget-per-cell is a documented follow-up (see Deviations).
- [x] Topology generators (`geometric` w/ forced connectivity via union-find, `line`, `clique`) + CLI (`cargo run -p sim -- --nodes N --scenario X`).
- [x] `two_nodes_hello` — green.
- [x] `broadcast_200_nodes` — 97.5% delivery, 0.69 rebroadcasts/node (well below a naive flood). *(≤0.5N remains a tuning target — see Deviations.)*
- [x] `partition_heal` — converges ≤ heal window, zero duplicate UI events.
- [x] `duplicate_storm` — 8 nodes echoing collapse to ≤20 transmissions.
- [x] `malicious_flooder` — honest message survives; flooder rate-limited (<50% of spam propagates).
- [x] `multi_hop_line_relay` — message survives 6 hops with the ends out of range.
- [x] `fragment_loss_timeout` — covered by `frag` unit test (`expired_partial_is_evicted`).
- [x] `zipbomb_rejected` — covered by `compress` unit tests (absolute-cap defense).
- [x] `ttl_clamp_dense` — covered by `config` unit test (`origin_ttl`).

### SQLCipher + FFI (M0 tail — toolchain-gated, deferred to M1)
- [!] `SqliteStore` via rusqlite + `bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl`. **Gated:** needs an OpenSSL source build; the `Store` trait + `MemoryStore` already let all logic be tested without it. Land alongside the Android app (M1) where on-device storage is first needed.
- [!] `meshcore-ffi` UniFFI crate (`MeshNode` object + `BleTransport`/`KeyVault`/`EventListener` callbacks). **Gated/deferred to M1:** the sans-IO core is FFI-ready by construction; the FFI surface is most useful to build against the real Gradle/NDK integration.
- [!] **JVM smoke test.** **Gated:** no JRE/Kotlin toolchain in this environment. This is the concrete M1 de-risking step — do it first thing in M1.

**M0 done when:** core green ✅. Gated tail rolls into M1.

## M1 — Android BLE glue: two phones chat offline — *hardware-gated*
First tasks (do the JVM smoke test + UniFFI plumbing here, since that's their natural home):
Gradle + rust-android-gradle wiring → `uniffi-bindgen` task → **JVM smoke test** → runtime
permissions → `MeshForegroundService` (`connectedDevice`) → GATT dual role → status-133
discipline → announce handshake → minimal Compose UI. See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §M1.
On-device steps cannot be verified by an autonomous loop — hand those to the human.

## M2 — Relay live (multi-hop, store-and-forward) — *hardware-gated*  · see §M2
## M3 — Noise XX DMs + QR verification (`noise.rs` is core-testable) · see §M3
## M4 — Media (voice notes + images, offer-and-fetch) · see §M4
## M5 — iOS shell · see §M5
## M6 — Hardening · see §M6

## Blockers
_(none — M0 core complete; M1 requires Android toolchain + physical phones)_

## Decisions / deviations log
- **BTreeMap/BTreeSet in core over HashMap** — HashMap's randomized iteration order made the
  simulator non-reproducible (same seed, different delivery). The maps whose iteration affects
  behavior (links, seen cache, relay scheduler, reassembler, subscriptions) now use ordered
  collections. Lookup-only maps (eph_keys, rate buckets) stay HashMap.
- **Relay probability tiers 1.0/1.0/0.85, not the documented 1.0/0.7/0.45** — simulator finding:
  at the ~8-link BLE connection cap, aggressive probabilistic thinning under-covers because a
  low-degree cut vertex can drop the only path to a sub-crowd. Counter-based suppression does the
  thinning instead. `docs/protocol.md` notes this; final values are a tuning target.
- **≤0.5N rebroadcast target not yet met** — currently 0.69 rebroadcasts/node at 97.5% delivery.
  Hitting ≤0.5N *and* ≥95% delivery simultaneously is open tuning (candidate: lower suppression
  threshold with per-neighbour-distinct counting). Tracked, not blocking.
- **Per-radio-cell airtime budget** — the sim models per-edge latency/loss but not a shared
  ~10-frame/s airtime cap per cell yet. Adequate for the current scenarios (rate limiting is
  enforced at ingress); add before trusting congestion-collapse numbers.
- **meshcore-ffi / SQLCipher / JVM smoke deferred to M1** — see gated tail above.
