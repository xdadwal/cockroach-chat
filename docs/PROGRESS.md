# PROGRESS — Cockroach Chat build ledger

This is the **single source of truth for "what's done / what's next."** The Ralph loop
(and any agent) reads this file first, does the **next unchecked task**, then updates it.

- Do the **smallest next unchecked `[ ]` task**, not a whole milestone.
- When a task is genuinely done **and verified** (tests/build pass — paste the command you
  ran), check it `[x]` and add a one-line note under it.
- If blocked, mark the task `[!]`, write the blocker under **Blockers**, and move to the
  next independent task.
- Keep this file honest. A checked box means verified, not "written."

**Status:** M0 core is **complete and green** — `cargo test --workspace` passes (49 core unit
tests + golden vectors + 3 topology + 6 mesh scenarios), `clippy -D warnings` clean, and the
200-node broadcast sim delivers to 97.5% of nodes. Remaining M0 tail (SQLCipher, UniFFI, JVM
smoke) is toolchain-gated and deferred into M1 where it is actually testable — see notes.
**Current milestone:** M0 done except gated tail → next up is **M1 (Android BLE glue)**.

Verify everything: `cargo test --workspace && cargo run -p sim -- --nodes 200 --scenario broadcast`

## M0 — Rust core + simulator

### Scaffolding
- [x] `docs/protocol.md` v0.1 (wire format, message types, all tunable numbers).
- [x] `docs/decisions/ADR-0001-rust-core-uniffi.md`.
- [x] Cargo workspace: root `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `crates/{meshcore,sim}`. `cargo build --workspace` ok. *(meshcore-ffi crate deferred to M1 — see gated tail.)*
- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` rust job: fmt + clippy `-D warnings` + test + vectors + sim smoke.

### meshcore — protocol core (pure, sans-IO)
- [x] `wire`: Header/Packet/MsgType/Tlv codec; unknown version rejected, unknown type preserved+relayed. 10 unit tests incl. fuzz-style short-buffer/oversize/trailing.
- [x] Golden vectors: `testvectors/packets.json` generated (`REGEN_VECTORS=1`) and verified by `tests/vectors.rs`; CI diffs against fresh bytes.
- [x] `frag`: fragmenter/reassembler sized to 182 B; 128 slots / 30 s / 1 MiB caps; out-of-order + duplicate + timeout tests.
- [x] `identity`: Ed25519+X25519, deterministic-from-seed, rotating eph id, hashcash `pow::mint`/`verify`.
- [x] `clock` (injected) + `config` (`Tunables` holds every protocol number, incl. relay probabilities).
- [x] `relay`: SeenCache (dedup+hear count), RateLimiter (token bucket + greylist), RelayScheduler (jitter + suppression), density-adaptive probability. All unit-tested.
- [x] `store`: `Store` trait + `MemoryStore` (history caps, envelopes, panic_wipe). Stores original packet bytes so sync preserves digests.
- [x] `channels`: name normalization + `SyncFilter` set-reconciliation.
- [x] `transport`: `Transport` trait + `TransportEvent`.
- [x] `node`: `MeshNode` orchestrator — announce, channel send/receive, sync, relay, tick; emits `MeshEvent`; sans-IO.

### sim — deterministic simulator
- [x] `SimTransport` + `SimClock` + `World` radio model (per-edge latency/loss/mtu). **Determinism** secured by using `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet` in the core (HashMap iteration order was breaking reproducibility). Airtime-budget-per-cell is a documented follow-up (see Deviations).
- [x] Topology generators (`geometric` w/ forced connectivity via union-find, `line`, `clique`) + CLI (`cargo run -p sim -- --nodes N --scenario X`).
- [x] `two_nodes_hello` — green.
- [x] `broadcast_200_nodes` — 97.5% delivery, 0.69 rebroadcasts/node (well below a naive flood). *(≤0.5N remains a tuning target — see Deviations.)*
- [x] `partition_heal` — converges ≤ heal window, zero duplicate UI events.
- [x] `duplicate_storm` — 8 nodes echoing collapse to ≤20 transmissions.
- [x] `malicious_flooder` — honest message survives; flooder rate-limited (<50% of spam propagates).
- [x] `multi_hop_line_relay` — message survives 6 hops with the ends out of range.
- [x] `fragment_loss_timeout` — covered by `frag` unit test (`expired_partial_is_evicted`).
- [x] `zipbomb_rejected` — covered by `compress` unit tests (absolute-cap defense).
- [x] `ttl_clamp_dense` — covered by `config` unit test (`origin_ttl`).

### SQLCipher + FFI (M0 tail — toolchain-gated, deferred to M1)
- [!] `SqliteStore` via rusqlite + `bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl`. **Gated:** needs an OpenSSL source build; the `Store` trait + `MemoryStore` already let all logic be tested without it. Land alongside the Android app (M1) where on-device storage is first needed.
- [!] `meshcore-ffi` UniFFI crate (`MeshNode` object + `BleTransport`/`KeyVault`/`EventListener` callbacks). **Gated/deferred to M1:** the sans-IO core is FFI-ready by construction; the FFI surface is most useful to build against the real Gradle/NDK integration.
- [!] **JVM smoke test.** **Gated:** no JRE/Kotlin toolchain in this environment. This is the concrete M1 de-risking step — do it first thing in M1.

**M0 done when:** core green ✅. Gated tail rolls into M1.

## M1 — Android BLE glue: two phones chat offline
The **toolchain and app are done and verified on the emulator** (the plumbing that the plan
called the "M1 choke point"). Only the literal BLE radio remains hardware-gated (emulators have
no Bluetooth).
- [x] `meshcore-ffi` UniFFI crate: concrete `FfiMeshNode` + `BleTransport`/`FfiEvent`. Compiles; Kotlin bindings generate.
- [x] Cross-compile to `arm64-v8a` via NDK 28 (`scripts/build-android-lib.sh`, env-var linker — no cargo-ndk needed).
- [x] Android Gradle app (AGP 8.5, Kotlin 1.9.24, Compose): builds a debug APK bundling the `.so` + JNA + bindings.
- [x] **Runs on the emulator**: two real `MeshNode`s exchange signed announces (peer discovery), and a channel message crosses from Ava → Ben **signature-verified** — the entire core runs on-device through UniFFI. (Loopback transport stands in for BLE.)
- [x] **Real BLE stack validated on hardware (Galaxy S23, Android 16)**: tapping "Start BLE mesh" (with runtime `BLUETOOTH_SCAN/CONNECT/ADVERTISE` + `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`) brings up the GATT server, advertising, and scanning with no crash — and a nearby central even connected to our advertised service (peripheral LINK UP). `BleMeshTransport` = one service UUID, RX write / TX notify, filtered scan + RSSI gate, status-133 close+retry, ≤5 links; `MeshForegroundService` = `connectedDevice`. The app has a "Real BLE" mode (permission flow + live status log) alongside the loopback demo.
- [x] **Two-phone chat over BLE — ACHIEVED (Galaxy S23 ↔ OnePlus CPH2613).** The phones discover each other, connect (dual central+peripheral), and exchange a channel message over Bluetooth with **no internet/servers**, delivered **✓ signature-verified** (Ed25519 against the key from the identity announce). Reconnect-after-restart also observed. This is the core M1 milestone.
  - Fix landed during testing: messages first arrived "unverified" because the link-up announce was dropped during GATT setup; now the app re-announces every ~3s so keys always propagate. (commit 80a6cd0)
  - Remaining polish (not blocking): full **bidirectional** verify needs both phones on the post-fix APK; **dedupe redundant links** to one peer (both sides advertise+scan+connect → ~5 links); a **GATT op queue** so the link-up announce write doesn't race the CCCD write; airplane-mode run.

Remaining M1 (SQLCipher store, iOS overflow-area filter) unchanged. See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §M1.

## M2 — Relay live (multi-hop, store-and-forward) — *hardware-gated*  · see §M2
## M3 — Noise XX encrypted DMs
Core **built and simulator-verified**; UI + QR verification remain.
- [x] `noise.rs`: Noise XX session (snow) — handshake, transport encrypt/decrypt, identity binding via `remote_static()`. 5 unit tests (bidirectional messages, third-party-can't-decrypt, tampered-ciphertext-rejected, identity binding).
- [x] DM integration in `node.rs`: `send_dm(fingerprint)`, handshake auto-init + drive, `DirectMessage`/`NoiseHandshake` handling, announce carries X25519 key, **MITM-binding** (Noise remote static must equal announced X25519 key), inbound-DM buffering (handles a DM overtaking the final handshake message over a relay). Events: `DmReceived`, `DmSession`.
- [x] Simulator scenario `encrypted_dm_relays_and_eavesdropper_is_blind`: A→B DM relays through a middle node that forwards but **cannot decrypt**; delivered + verified.
- [x] FFI: `send_dm(peer_fp_hex, text)` + `FfiEvent::DirectMessage`/`DmSession`.
- [ ] DM UI on phones (tap a peer → encrypted DM thread); demoable on the two-phone rig.
- [ ] QR in-person verification + petnames; verified/unverified/unauthenticated UI states.
- [ ] Per-message ratchet with a skipped-key window (current: snow transport — forward-secure per session, but multiple DMs must arrive in order; out-of-order needs the ratchet). Persist sessions encrypted.

## Blockers
_(none — M0 core complete; M1 requires Android toolchain + physical phones)_

## Decisions / deviations log
- **BTreeMap/BTreeSet in core over HashMap** — HashMap's randomized iteration order made the
  simulator non-reproducible (same seed, different delivery). The maps whose iteration affects
  behavior (links, seen cache, relay scheduler, reassembler, subscriptions) now use ordered
  collections. Lookup-only maps (eph_keys, rate buckets) stay HashMap.
- **Relay probability tiers 1.0/1.0/0.85, not the documented 1.0/0.7/0.45** — simulator finding:
  at the ~8-link BLE connection cap, aggressive probabilistic thinning under-covers because a
  low-degree cut vertex can drop the only path to a sub-crowd. Counter-based suppression does the
  thinning instead. `docs/protocol.md` notes this; final values are a tuning target.
- **≤0.5N rebroadcast target not yet met** — currently 0.69 rebroadcasts/node at 97.5% delivery.
  Hitting ≤0.5N *and* ≥95% delivery simultaneously is open tuning (candidate: lower suppression
  threshold with per-neighbour-distinct counting). Tracked, not blocking.
- **Per-radio-cell airtime budget** — the sim models per-edge latency/loss but not a shared
  ~10-frame/s airtime cap per cell yet. Adequate for the current scenarios (rate limiting is
  enforced at ingress); add before trusting congestion-collapse numbers.
- **meshcore-ffi / SQLCipher / JVM smoke deferred to M1** — see gated tail above.
